# <span id="page-4-0"></span>**1. GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CATALOG OF MARKED GOODS**

The National Catalog of Marked Goods of the Russian Federation (hereinafter - the National Catalog) was created to ensure uniformity, standardization and harmonization of data about goods, as well as to maintain all necessary reference information with uniform description thereof in the entire distribution chain, from a manufacturer and/or importer of goods to retail.

#### Main functions of the National Catalog:

- provide information contained in the registers to Participants and all users of the catalog within their competence and access rights;
- maintain a register of Participants of the National Catalog;
- enable manufacturers and importers to register marked goods items;
- maintain a register of cards of the marked goods (digital data sheets of the marked goods);
- provide information on the permit documents of marked goods items according to the current regulatory legal acts of EAEU countries;
- transfer a unique code of the nomenclature goods item to the marking and traceability system for its inclusion into a structure of the marking code of the item of goods;
- ensure legal value of the information transmitted by goods circulation participants to the Unified Goods Catalog of the Russian Federation.

# <span id="page-5-0"></span>**2. GENERAL PARAMETERS FOR WORKING WITH THE NC API**

Goods circulation participants' information exchange in the National Catalog is performed based on the electronic information services with the use of standard protocols and interfaces of electronic interaction that retain the mode of the guaranteed delivery of the data packets:

- via user account;
- via Application Programming Interface (API).

Entering data into the National Catalog via API of the National Catalog is performed according to the methods specified in this document.

- [https://api.nk.sandbox.crptech.ru](https://api.nk.sandbox.crptech.ru/) test environment address;
- [апи.национальный-каталог.рф](https://апи.национальный-каталог.рф/) production environment address.

When using the API methods of the National Catalog, you should specify an access key ("apikey") or TT GIS authentication token (Authorization: Bearer Token) in the request. For more details, see section ["2.2.](#page-5-2)  [Universal Request Parameters"](#page-5-2).

## <span id="page-5-1"></span>**2.1. Limit of API Requests**

There are personal limitations applied to each organization, general (for all methods) and private (for the selected method). Time is calculated starting from the first request in a series.

| Note | Once the request limit has been exceeded, a new series of requests can be initiated<br>5 minutes after the first request has been |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|      | sent                                                                                                                              |
|      |                                                                                                                                   |

The number of executed requests in the current series is passed in each API response in the API-Usage-Limit HTTP header (example: API-Usage-Limit: 1/500) within the general limit and API-Method-Usage-Limit (example: API-Method-Usage-Limit: 1/10) within the private limit, if it has been set.

## <span id="page-7-0"></span>**2.4. HTTP ETag (Version Control)**

The "Entity Tag" header (ETag for short) is used to transfer a page content hash. If the page has been modified, the page hash will also be modified. By comparing the client-side hash with the hash generated on the server side, cache can determine if the page has been modified and should be resent. It is used for the following methods: [product,](Get#_3.1.2._Method_) [short-product,](Get#_3.1.3._Method_) [categories,](Get#_3.3.1._Method_) [brands.](Get#_3.3.4._Method_)

When called, the server returns a resource with the respective ETag value, which is in the ETag field of the HTTP header:

```
ETag: "686897696a7c876b7e"
```

Then, the resource can be cached along with its ETag. Later, when receiving a page from the same address, the previously saved ETag value can be sent along with the request in the If-None-Match field (it is specified in HTTP header):

```
If-None-Match: "686897696a7c876b7e"
```

To this request the server compares the client's ETag with the ETag of the current resource version. If ETag values match, the resource has not been modified, and the server sends back a very brief response with the 304 Not Modified HTTP status. Status 304 means that the cached version is still valid, and no data update is required. However, if ETag values do not match, the resource has been modified, and the server returns full response. If so, the resource cache and its ETag can be updated.

When using the ETag and receiving the response with the 304 Not Modified status, the API usage limit is not applied.

The ETag hash length for the [product](Get#_3.1.2._Method_) method depends on the number of goods in the response. Maximum length: 4 Kb.

#### Example of a header with ETag:

```
Content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
API-Usage-Limit: 1/500
Etag: "38fho43p543re634c993ec28581d867"
Status Code: 200
```

#### Example of the response with status 304:

```
Content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Status Code: 304
```

# <span id="page-9-2"></span><span id="page-9-1"></span>**3.1. Getting information about the card**

#### **3.1.1. Method "Get information about your own card"**

The method "feed-product" returns all available information about a goods card (about yours or about the one to which you have been given access by the right holder as part of the functionality of work with subaccounts), i.e. all filled attributes regardless of a card status (except for the cards that have the "Requires processing" status).

#### **Note:**

- it requires mandatory indication of one of the parameters: "gtin" ("Goods code"), "good\_id" ("Goods ID"), "gtins" ("List of goods codes") or "good\_ids" ("List of goods identifiers");
- if two mandatory parameters "gtin" ("Goods code") and "good\_id" ("Goods ID") are specified, then a result of the selection by "good\_id" ("Goods ID") is returned. In this case GTIN is ignored;
- if two mandatory parameters "gtins" ("List of goods codes") and "good\_ids" ("List of goods identifiers") are specified, then a result of the selection is returned for both parameters;
- if the parameters "gtins" ("List of goods codes") and "good\_ids" ("List of goods identifiers") or one of them is specified, then the maximum number of goods items in the request should not exceed 25;
- if one of the parameters "gtin" ("Goods code") or "good\_id" ("Goods ID") and one of the parameters "gtins" ("List of goods codes") or "good\_ids" ("List of goods identifiers") are specified, then a response with code 400 is returned.

#### <span id="page-21-0"></span>**3.1.2. Method "Get information about card"**

The "product" method returns information about the published and archived goods cards. It is recommended to use the [feed-product](Get#_3.1.1._Method_) method to view information about your goods cards.

A particular limit is set for the method, which is 100 requests in a series.

#### **Note**:

- it requires mandatory indication of one of the parameters: "gtin" ("Goods code"), "good\_id" ("Goods ID"), "gtins" ("List of goods codes") or "good\_ids" ("List of goods identifiers");
- if two mandatory parameters "gtin" ("Goods code") and "good\_id" ("Goods ID") are specified, then a result of the selection by good\_id is returned. And "gtin" ("Goods code") is ignored;
- if two mandatory parameters "gtins" ("List of goods codes") and "good\_ids" ("List of goods identifiers") are specified, then a result of the selection is returned for both parameters;
- if the parameters "gtins" ("List of goods codes") and "good\_ids" ("List of goods identifiers") or one of them is specified, then the maximum number of goods items in the request should not exceed 25;
- if one of the parameters "gtin" ("Goods code") or "good\_id" ("Goods ID") and one of the parameters "gtins" ("List of goods codes") or "good\_ids" ("List of goods identifiers") are specified, then a response with code 400 is returned;

- if the "good\_id" ("Goods ID") parameter is specified, then a goods item with the corresponding identifier or a response with code 404 is returned;
- if the "gtin" ("Goods code") parameter is specified, then a goods item with the corresponding goods code or a response with code 404 is returned.

## <span id="page-32-0"></span>**3.1.3. Method "Get brief information about card"**

The method "short-product" returns short or complete information about a product (goods item). This method is available only for the companies for which the role "Integrator / Software developer" has been selected when registering access to the API of the National Catalog.

#### **Note:**

- if a card has been created with the "is\_sim" flag ("Flag indicating whether an industrial marking card has been created"), the response will indicate that such a goods card does not exist;
- it requires mandatory indication of one of the parameters: "gtin" ("Goods code"), "good\_id" ("List of goods identifiers"), "gtins" ("List of goods codes") or "good\_ids" ("List of goods identifiers");
- if two mandatory parameters "gtin" ("Goods code") and "good\_id" ("List of goods identifiers") are specified, then a result of the selection by good\_id is returned. And "gtin" ("Goods code") is ignored;
- if two mandatory parameters "gtins" ("List of goods codes") and "good\_ids" ("List of goods identifiers") are specified, then a result of the selection is returned for both parameters;
- if the parameters "gtins" ("List of goods codes") and "good\_ids" ("List of goods identifiers") or one of them is specified, then the maximum number of goods items in the request should not exceed 25;
- if one of the parameters "gtin" ("Goods code") or "good\_id" ("Goods ID") and one of the parameters "gtins" ("List of goods codes") or "good\_ids" ("List of goods identifiers") are specified, then a response with code 400 is returned;
- if the "good\_id" ("List of goods identifiers") parameter is specified, then the item with the corresponding identifier or the response with code 404 is returned;
- if the "gtin" ("Goods code") parameter is specified, then a goods item with the corresponding goods code or a response with code 404 is returned.

You can navigate through them using the "limit" ("Number of the records in the response") and "offset" ("Shift relative to the start of the issue") parameters.

## **Note**:

- if none of the "from\_date" or "to\_date" parameters is passed in the request, then the method searches for cards updated one month ahead of the current date;
- if a company has more than 10,000 goods cards updated within the period specified in the "to\_date" and/or "from\_date" parameters, then a response with code 413 will be returned;
- if the "limit" ("Number of the records in the response") and "offset" ("Shift relative to the start of the issue") parameters are specified in the request, then their total value must not exceed 10,000, otherwise a response with code 413 will be returned;
- if the "limit" ("Number of the records in the response") and "offset" ("Shift relative to the start of the issue") parameters are not specified in the request, then "limit" ("Number of the records in the response") is considered equal to 1,000, and "offset" ("Shift relative to the start of the issue") is equal to 0;
- if the "from\_date" and "to\_date" parameters are simultaneously passed in the request, then the specified period can be more than a month.

## <span id="page-46-0"></span>**3.1.5. Method "Check changes in cards"**

The method "etagslist" returns a list of all goods that belong to a certain owner together with a hash of the page content (for more information about hash, see section ["HTTP ETag \(Version control\)"](#page-6-1)). It is intended to promptly receive the list of hashes, compare them with the local storage and update information on goods (method ["product"\)](Get#_3.1.2._Method_) with modified hashes, i.e. there are new data. Thus, it is possible to identify goods, the cards of which have been modified.

#### <span id="page-54-0"></span>**3.2.2. Method "Create or edit a card"**

The method "feed" allows companies – goods owners to create and update goods. The goods cards are created and updated by means of feeds — update packages formed on the side of the user.

Important When creating and updating goods cards, it is important to take into account the allowed Unicode characters

The method returns "feed\_id" (identifier of the received feed) or an error.

#### Limitations:

- feed size 25 MB;
- number of the goods in a feed 500;
- number of goods codes in a set 1,000.

Once the feed size limit or the feed goods number limit has been exceeded, error 413 is returned.

When an error occurs in a data scheme, an error with code 400 will be received.

Note Information about sent update packages is stored for one year

**URL:** /v3/feed

**Method:** POST

#### <span id="page-69-0"></span>**3.2.3. Method "Check update package processing status"**

The method "feed-status" is intended to verify a status of the previously sent update package (feed). A result can be retrieved only for the feeds that have been sent by a company (laboratory).

Note If the update package has the "Processing" status for more than a day, it will be automatically transferred to the "Rejected" status and will need to be sent for processing again

Information on the sent update packages is stored for one year.

**URL:** /v3/feed-status

**Method:** GET

## **Request string example:**

```
GET <url of environment>/v3/feed-
status?apikey=XXX&supplier_key=YYY&feed_id=7126&verbose=false

#### <span id="page-80-0"></span>**3.3.2. Method "Get an attribute list"**

The method "attributes" returns a list of attributes to create a goods card with a specified FEACN code or category identifier. If the FEACN code or category identifier is not specified, a complete list of the attributes that are available for the account from which a request is made, is returned.

If FEACN does not uniquely determine a goods group, to obtain a correct list of the attributes, you should first request a list of categories corresponding to this FEACN (see ["categories"](Get#_3.3.1._Method_)), then request an attribute model by using this method ("attributes") by an identifier of the appropriate category ("cat\_id" parameter).

Up-to-date information on the marked goods groups and FEACN codes is presented on the website честныйзнак.рф.

**URL:** /v3/attributes

**Method:** GET

#### **Request string example:**

Example of the request with a category identifier:

GET <url of environment>/v3/attributes?apikey=XXX&cat\_id=30933&attr\_type=m

## Example of the request with FEACN code:

GET <url of environment>/v3/attributes?apikey=XXX&tnved=3303&attr\_type=m

#### Example of the request with an indicator of the card of the goods that have the "Set" type:

GET <url of environment>/v3/attributes?apikey=XXX&is\_set=1

#### **Request string parameters:**

#### <span id="page-110-0"></span>**3.5.3. Method "Get XML file that is required to control access to subaccounts"**

The method "linked-accounts-documents" is intended **to generate** an XML file containing information about granting or revocation of permission to use own goods codes to order marking codes and to introduce goods into circulation to other organizations (mechanism of subaccounts).

To use permissions, it is necessary to use the method ["linked-accounts-sign"](Sign#_3.5.4._Method_) that allows to sign the generated XML file and to use the required permissions for a subaccount.

Access to goods by the mechanism of the subaccount can be full or partial (access according to a fixed list of the goods codes).

The maximum number of items (organizations) in a request should not exceed 100.

The maximum number of goods codes for an organization should not exceed 1,000.

Note

- Full access can be granted before or after partial access is granted. If you have full access, partial access is not taken into account;
- If an organization has been granted partial and full access, then when full access is revoked, the partial access remains active;
- Using the sub-account configuration mechanism, companies that own goods codes can grant access only to Russian goods codes (046) and industrial marking goods codes (004).

## <span id="page-113-0"></span>**3.5.4. Method "Sign granting or revoking permission to a subaccount to use goods codes for MCs emission"**

The method "linked-accounts-sign" is intended **to sign** an XML file containing information about granting or revocation of permission to use own goods codes to order marking codes and to introduce goods into circulation to other organizations (a mechanism of subaccounts).

Source XML file for signing is formed by the method ["linked-accounts-documents"](Get#_3.5.3._Method_), after that it is encoded in base64 in order to be used in the method "linked-accounts-sign" (this method).

Signing is done by using a certificate in PKCS#7 format.

The maximum number of items (organizations) in a request should not exceed 100.

The maximum number of goods codes for an organization should not exceed 1,000.

### **Note**

- Full access can be issued before or after partial access is granted, and if you have full access, partial access is not taken into account;
- If an organization has been granted partial and full access, then when full access is revoked, the partial access remains active;
- Using the sub-account configuration mechanism, companies that own goods codes can grant access only to Russian goods codes (046) and industrial marking goods codes (004)

# <span id="page-120-0"></span>**Modifications introduced in the previous versions of the document**

v.5.61 dated 03.06.2026

Working with industrial marking (IM) goods codes through the sub-account configuration mechanism is now available for the *"Radio-electronic products"*, *"Radio-electronic products. Laptops and smartphones"* goods groups. As a result, IM goods codes can be specified in the following methods:

- ["Get a list of companies and goods codes for which access has been granted, by subaccount"](Get#_3.5.2._Method_) (/v3/linked-gtins) — in the "gtin" request parameter ("Goods code");
- "Get XML file that is [required to control access to subaccounts"](Get#_3.5.3._Method_) (/v3/linked-accounts-documents)  in the "linkedGoods" array ("An array of goods cards for which access is granted or revoked").

Additionally, the ["Sign granting or revoking permission to a subaccount to use goods codes for MCs](Sign#_3.5.4._Method_)  [emission"](Sign#_3.5.4._Method_) method (/v3/linked-accounts-sign) can be used to sign an XML file containing IM goods codes.

#### v.5.60 dated 02.06.2026

The maximum number of goods items per request has been reduced from 25 to 10 for the following methods:

- ["Method "Get XML for subsequent signing a card""](Get#_3.4.1._Method_) (/v3/feed-product-document);
- ["Method "Sign a card by using an attached signature""](#page-103-0) (/v3/feed-product-sign);
- ["Method "Sign a card by using the detached signature""](Sign#_3.4.3._Method_) (/v3/feed-product-sign-pkcs).

## v.5.59 dated 30.04.2026

The "*Clothing items, bed, table, bath and kitchen linens*" goods group has been renamed "*Light industry*".

## v.5.58 dated 27.04.2026

In the description of the ["3.2.2. Method "Create or edit a card""](#page-54-0) method (/v3/feed):

- the requirement for the "cat\_id" request body parameter ("Category identifier") has been changed from mandatory to optional;
- request examples have been updated:
  - creating a new goods card in \* . xml format;
  - updating an existing goods card in \* .json and \* .xml formats.

#### v.5.57 dated 02.04.2026

• A new method to describe goods has been implemented for the *"Radio-electronic products. Laptops and smartphones"* goods group — creation of an industrial marking card (the IM card). The system automatically assigns a code with the 004 prefix to goods. These cards can be created for any package type. The IM card lifecycle (attribute completion, status changes) is identical to that of a regular goods card.

To create an IM card, the "is\_sim" parameter ("Flag indicating whether an industrial marking card has been created") must be specified in the ["3.2.2. Method "Create or edit a card""](#page-54-0) (/v3/feed). If this parameter is specified, the following cannot be provided:

- "good\_id" ("Goods item identifier");
- "gtin" ("Goods code");
- "is\_tech\_gtin" ("An attribute to create a goods card with technical goods code");
- "is\_kit" ("An attribute to create a bundle").

If the request has been successfully processed, the generated goods code will be returned in the response of the ["3.2.3. Method "Check update package](#page-69-0) processing status"" (/v3/feed-status).

#### Limitations:

- subaccount configuration for ordering marking codes for codes with the 004 prefix is not supported;
- industrial marking group packages and sets can include only codes with the 004 prefix;
- regular sets and group packages (with prefixes other than 004) cannot contain codes with the 004 prefix;
- information about industrial marking cards cannot be obtained using the following methods:
  - ["3.1.3. Method "Get brief information about card""](#page-32-0) (/v3/short-product);
  - ["3.2.1. Method "Generate a goods code""](#page-52-1) (/v3/generate-gtins);
  - ["3.2.4. Method "Change the photo size""](#page-76-0) (/v3/image);
  - ["3.3.6. Method "Get information about a permitting document by a goods code and](#page-91-0)  [INN""](#page-91-0) (/v4/rd-info-by-gtin).
- The "is\_sim" response parameter ("Industrial marking card flag") has been added to the ["3.1.1.](#page-9-2)  [Method "Get information about your own](#page-9-2) card"" (/v3/feed-product) and ["3.1.2. Method "Get](#page-21-0)  [information about card""](#page-21-0) (/v3/product).
- A clarification stating that IM card details are unavailable in the method has been removed from the description of the ["3.1.5. Method "Check changes in cards""](#page-46-0) (/v3/etagslist).

- Example requests to create a goods card with an industrial goods code for a unit of goods and a set have been added to the description of the ["3.2.2. Method "Create or edit a card""](#page-54-0) method (/v3/feed).
- A clarification stating that IM card details are unavailable in the methods has been added to the descriptions of the ["3.2.1. Method "Generate a goods code""](#page-52-1) (/v3/generate-gtins) and ["3.2.4. Method](#page-76-0)  ["Change the photo size""](#page-76-0) (/v3/image).

#### v.5.56 dated 30.03.2026

In "Catalog – [Groups of permitting documents statuses"](#page-118-0), the description has been updated for a group of permitting document statuses with the "11" code.

#### v.5.55 dated 25.03.2026

A new method to describe goods has been implemented for the *"Radio-electronic products"* goods group creation of an industrial marking card (the IM card). IM cards can be created for any package type. Registration in GS1 RUS is not required — the system will automatically assign a code with the 004 prefix to goods. The IM card lifecycle (attribute completion, status changes) is identical to that of a regular goods card.

To create an IM card, the "is\_sim" request body parameter ("Indicator that an industrial marking card is created") has been added to the ["Create or edit a card"](Create#_3.2.2._Method_) method (/v3/feed). If this parameter is specified, the following cannot be provided:

- "good\_id" ("Goods item identifier");
- "gtin" ("Goods code");
- "is\_tech\_gtin" ("Indicator of the goods card with technical code of the goods");
- "is\_kit" ("Indicator of creation of the bundle").

If a request has been successfully processed, the assigned goods code will be returned in the response of the "Check [update package processing status"](Check#_3.2.3._Method_) method (/v3/feed-status).

#### Limitations:

- subaccount configuration for ordering marking codes for codes with the 004 prefix is not supported;
- industrial marking group packages and industrial marking sets can include only codes with the 004 prefix;
- regular sets and group packages (with prefixes other than 004) cannot contain codes with the 004 prefix;
- information about industrial marking cards cannot be obtained using the following methods:

- ["Get brief information about card"](Get#_3.1.3._Method_) (/v3/short-product);
- ["Check changes in cards"](Check#_3.1.5._Method_) (/v3/etagslist);
- ["Get information about a permitting document by a goods code and INN"](Get#_3.3.6._Method_) (/v4/rd-info-bygtin).
